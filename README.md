# Streaming-Data-for-Predictive-Maintenance-with-Linear-Regression-Based-Alerts
ðŸ“‚ Practical Lab 1: Streaming Data for Predictive Maintenance with Linear Regression-Based Alerts
Context
In the Data Stream Visualization Workshop, you learned how to stream, store, and visualize industrial current data.
This lab extends that work: you will now implement regression-based anomaly detection to generate alerts and errors when currents deviate significantly from their expected values.

This task simulates a Predictive Maintenance scenario, where early alerts and errors can flag potential failures before they occur.

# Learning Objectives
### By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:

Extend a streaming pipeline with machine learning models.

Apply linear regression to detect unusual consumption trends.

Analyze regression residuals and discover meaningful thresholds for anomaly detection.

Implement an alerts/errors module in a streaming context.

Deliver a professional GitHub repository with reproducible code, data, and documentation.
