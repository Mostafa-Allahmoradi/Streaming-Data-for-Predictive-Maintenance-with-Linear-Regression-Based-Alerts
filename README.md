📂 Practical Lab 1: Streaming Data for Predictive Maintenance with Linear Regression-Based Alerts

## Project Summary
This task simulates a Predictive Maintenance scenario, where early alerts and errors can flag potential failures before they occur.

## ❗ Clarify the Problem

Issue: Torque Tube Failure – 480 Minutes of Downtime
Root cause is the age of the equipment.
Roadblocks: Options to monitor equipment health are limited.
GAP: Lack of a tool to avoid reactive response to equipment breakdown.
